This is Star Wars database application.
I use [swapi.dev](https://swapi.dev/) for data and [starwars-visualguide.com](https://starwars-visualguide.com/) for images.

Application shows:

- image with SW person, planets or starships
- h3 tag with name
- li elements with data fields
- Button "NEXT". It loads the next object.


At the top of the page, there is a Header component. When you click on the corresponding header menu, only the required component is rendered. People is render by default.
